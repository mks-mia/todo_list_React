# 📝 React Todo List App

This is a simple and interactive **Todo List app** built with React. It allows users to create headings and add multiple list items under each heading. This project is part of my learning journey in the **"Developing Front-End Apps with React"** course by IBM on Coursera.

- Add multiple list items under each heading
- Delete individual headings (along with their lists)
- Maintains state using React hooks (`useState`)

## 🧰 Tech Stack
